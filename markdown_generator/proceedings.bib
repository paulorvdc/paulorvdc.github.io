abstract = {The biodiversity of tropical environments offers a rich variety of species for the process of finding new drugs based on Natural Products. Databases like The Brazilian Biodiversity Natural Products Database (NUBBEDB), where they hold compounds and characteristics about them, are important for computational assistance. However, these databases are difficult to update since data about compounds is mostly published in academic papers. Therefore, automatic Knowledge Extraction like on the state-of-the-art Benchmark for Natural Product Knowledge Extraction from Academic Literature (NatUKE), is an important task for the field. The dataset uses a Knowledge Graph version of the NUBBEDB and it evaluates different Knowledge Graph Embedding models for the task. The best performer from NatUKE is an embedding propagation model that uses pre-trained language models as the start-up embedding for the nodes that contain text data. This work investigates two avenues for increasing performance out of NatUKE. We focused on better text extraction from PDFs and using Large Language Models as the start-up embeddings. Our results surpassed state-of-the-art in 3 out of 5 extracted features while maintaining competitive performance on the remaining features.},
